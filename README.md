# Big-Data-Analysis

This repo contains several interesting projects using machine learning methods ranging from:

1. Regression [Bankruptcy Prediction](Bankruptcy_Prediction_via_Regression.ipynb)
2. K-mean Clustering [Stock Movement] (Stock-Movement-with-KmeanClustering.ipynb)
3. Support Vector Machine [Credit Card Application] (Support_Vector_Machine_Template_for_Credit_Card_Applications.ipynb)
4. Reinforment Learning [Reinforcement Learning] (Reinforcement-Learning.ipynb)
5. Deep Neural Network [Insurance Purchase Prediction] (Insurance_Purchase_Prediction_Using_Deep_Neural_Network.ipynb)
6. Big Data with PySpark 

There are also many interesting data preprocessing methods such as :
1. Extracting data using XML
2. Feature analysis with filtering
3. Dimenstion Reduction using Principal Component Analysis

The final project for this course is Forecasting GDP and Inflation rate using all learnt methods. Final Project page can be view at:
